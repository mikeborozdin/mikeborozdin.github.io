In this post we'll talk about defining what an MVP should be. It’s part of [the ‘Product Management in the Open’ series](/product-management-in-the-open). The goal of the series is describe the process of product managing a mobile app - Best in Town / Best in Edinburgh. Please, [check this page to read more about the app itself](/product-management-in-the-open/idea). 

This post describes my thinking back in the beginning of 2017. Not everything I did at that time was correct and I also try to reflect on some of the mistakes here.<!-- more -->

MVP for Limited Audience
====

Okay, so in the previous post, we've set a value hypothesis and agreed on the KPIs. Now, it's time to prove or disprove the hypothesis.

When we set the KPI of retention we made an implicit assumption that we would build a product to validate the hypothesis. There could be other ways validate hypotheses, in general. For example, create a questionnaire or produce a video and gauge a number of likes.

Moreover, the product we're building is going to be a mobile app (**WHY**?)

And that comes with a certain cost. Not only we have to build an app, but also go through a rigorous process of getting accepted to a marketplace (Apple App Store and Google Play Store).

That would all take time. Luckily, I had around a dozen of friends who seemed like the target audience for Best in Town (**explain that I made an implicit assumption of choosing only the local population).

So I made a decision to create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that I'll only distribute among friends. That would allow me to gain some insights (**how about proving my hypothesis**).

Scope
====

Okay, now we need to define the scope of the MVP. Obviously, it should be just as small as to validate our hypothesis. But the specifics nature of the product also dictates that the scope is split between three different categories:

* **App features** - which features should be in the app itself?
* **Content** - Best in Town is a content app. No-one will use if it doesn't have enough information about places to go. 
* **Mobile platform** - do we want to target any specific platform firs t- iOS or Android?

Features
----
Okay, which features does the app need to have? Let's have a look at the hypothesis first.

> **Hypothesis:** People need an ability to see ratings for a meal/drink as opposed to the entire place

It implies that people first have to choose what they are looking for (cocktails, vegan food (**why didn't I put it as a category?!**)). Then, they'll see a places that with ratings for whatever they are looking for.

Also, users will want to know where a place is, so we have to have an ability of showing that. 

Okay, so far it sounds like users will be passive consumers of the content. They will look for places, but they won't rate things or add new places. Does it cause any problems? Potentially. Going a bit forward, I'll tell you that the content - i.e. a list of places, information on what they offer and ratings, are manually curated. I've been asked many times about where I've got all the data. No, I haven't got it from TripAdvisor, Google Maps or Yelp. They all display rating for the entire place and not a specific meal or a dish. Grabbing content from them would defeat the purpose of Best in Town. So, all the places had to be added manually. Luckily, I was living in Edinburgh, UK at that time. And it seemed like a perfect place to test an idea like that. The town was small enough and compact enough for me and my friends to know all noteworthy bars and restaurants. Equally, it had a vibrant food & drink scene - there was always opening of a new establishments and the locals had enough disposable income to happily spend it over a nice glass of wine. Plus, Edinburgh was second tourist destination in the UK after London (**check how many tourists a year**).

So, populating the app with the initial content wasn't a huge problem. But... the app would get stale if there was no way of adding to that content. In other words, if there was no way to rate, say, a craft beer at place XYZ, then people will never see a community rating, instead they'll see rating provided by me or one of my friends. The same applies to adding more places. People need to have that ability.

Mobile Platform (iOS vs Android)
----
Mobile market is split between primarily between two platforms iOS (iPhone & iPad) and Android. Which platform do I target first? The challenge was that my groups of friends used different devices. A particular challenge was that I had an iPhone, while one of the my most foodies friend (target market) had an Android.

Luckily, there are tools that allow you to target both platforms while writing the same code. So, I decided to target two platforms at the same time.
