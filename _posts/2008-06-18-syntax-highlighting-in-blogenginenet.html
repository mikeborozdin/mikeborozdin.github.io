<p>
It is not obvious that BlogEngine.NET has a built-in syntax highlighting extension. I mean the current versions 1.3.1, I&#39;m not sure about the old versions though. Anyway you can find it in the extensions settings, it is enabled by default.

<p>
So, if you need to paste a code snipped, just paste it in the text area and surround it with the [ code:&lt;language&gt;][/code ] tags
</p>
<p>
&lt;language&gt; may has one of the following values:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>c#</li>
	<li>vb</li>
	<li>js</li>
	<li>html</li>
	<li>xml</li>
	<li>tsql</li>
	<li>msh (Windows PowerShell script language)</li>
</ul>
<p>
It can take some other parameters, like ln for toggling line numbers, however if you set this parameter your layout will get broken for some reasons.
