Since I have already touched a topic of SQL Server, I want to inform that <a href="http://www.discountasp.net/index.aspx?refcode=MIKEBOR" target="_blank">Discount ASP.NET</a> has launched SQL 2008 Hosting Beta Program. If you are already a subscriber of <a href="http://www.discountasp.net/index.aspx?refcode=MIKEBOR" target="_blank">Discount ASP.NET</a>, you can activate it in your control panel, if not, then you can <a href="http://www.discountasp.net/index.aspx?refcode=MIKEBOR" target="_blank">subscribe</a> if you are looking for a good hosting provider.<br />
