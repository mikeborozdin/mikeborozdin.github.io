Finally, I have installed <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> and got amazed by its features. It does really simplify your blogging and save your time. With Live Writer you don&#39;t have to write a post in Word and then paste it to your blog, sometimes you even have to paste it to a another editor in order to get rid of Word text formatting. Now you don&#39;t have to do that.
</p>
  
<p>
Windows Live Writer supports many blogging platform, from Live Spaces to BlogEngine.NET and WordPress
</p>
  
<p>
Windows Live Writer has a built-in spell checker, so you don&#39;t need Word to check your spelling, it has nice formatting features, it supports different plug-in, so you can get a syntax highlighter, which is not available by default unfortunately.&nbsp; 
</p>
  
<p>
You can preview your posts, post preview is integrated into your blog design that looks awesome.

The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that it&#39;s not very obvious how to add new tags, because when your click the &quot;TAG&quot; button it only lists the existing tags, you can add new ones in the &quot;Keywords field in the properties section.
