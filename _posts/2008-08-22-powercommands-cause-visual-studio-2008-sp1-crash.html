<p>I was badly surprised today, when Visual Studio 2008 SP1 suddenly quit while loading the &quot;Choose Toolbox Items&quot; dialog. After some Googling I learnt that such things were caused by PowerCommands, thanks to the guys <a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1222006/2570275.aspx">here</a>. However, the workaround is pretty simply, you just have to re-install PowerCommands. After that procedure Visual Studio starts working properly again.</p>
