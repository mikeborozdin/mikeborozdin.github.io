<p>I apologize, there were few mistakes in the <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article on ASP.NET Image Uploading</a>. There was a logic error in the resizing method. Furthermore, I decided to use the &lt;asp:FileUpload /&gt; control instead of the HTML input, FileUpload automatically adds a proper encryption type to the form.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article</a> is still available by its <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">previous URL</a>, but now it's correct, as well as the project files.</p>
