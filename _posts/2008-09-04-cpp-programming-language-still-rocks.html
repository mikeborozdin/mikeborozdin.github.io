<p>Even though I don't program with C++ much these days, I still love the book entitled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">C++ Programming Language</a>" by Bjarne Stroustrup - the creator of the C++ programming language. Its first edition was published in 1986, but the book still remains informative even for non-C++ programmers.&nbsp; Unlike many other programming books, this one doesn't focus only on the language itself,&nbsp; in contrast, there are many very useful chapters on various programming paradigms, including the object oriented one, for sure. Besides, it does really explain the p

urpose of the object oriented method and its benefits. Moreover, there is information on software architecture, class design and on programming process as a whole. <!-- more --></p>
<p>The reason why I fetched it from my bookshelf was the constant questions in programming forums about benefits of OOP. The object oriented way of programming seems to be very natural for me, however I decided to prove my thoughts about OOP by consulting an authoritative source. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">The book</a> by Bjarne Stroustrup who was one of the founders of object oriented programming is that authority source. While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">this book</a> I recognized many contemporary patterns and principles, although Bjarne Stroustrup never calls them with the names they have today.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are a lot of books on design patterns, programming principles and etc that use Java or .NET as an example, however C++ is also an excellent example, simply because it was the language that inspired the Java and C# creators. So, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">this particular book</a> is written by the real father of the modern programming principles, even if he is not considered to be fashionable today. Therefore, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">it</a> can be recommended to any programmer, no matter which language they use.</p>
