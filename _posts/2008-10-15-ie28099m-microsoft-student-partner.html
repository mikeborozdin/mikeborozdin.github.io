<p>Well, I apologize for not posting anything for such a long time. Anyway, I’m happy to announce that I’ve become a Microsoft Student Partner. I took an active part in the Microsoft User Group in my university that was organized by other Student Partners. I decided to apply for this program and my application was accepted.</p>  <p>Now I’m responsible for organization of student IT events related to Microsoft products. It’s very challenging and interesting activity. And I’m happy with it now. </p>  <p>You can learn more about this program on this <a target="_blank" href="http://student-partners.com/">web site</a>, you can also apply for it there.</p>
