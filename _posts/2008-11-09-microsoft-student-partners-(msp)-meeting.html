<p>Well, it’s been a very long time since I posted anything. That’s certainly wrong. I must correct myself ;-)!</p>  <p>Anyway, I want to tell you that I had a great opportunity to visit a meeting of Microsoft Student Partners from Russia in my city. I must admit it was an incredible event. I met so many people who are really passionate about technology. They are eager to tell people about great technologies, as well! It’s a great think that we can gather all together and get to know each other :)! I must thank Microsoft for that :)!</p>
