<p>I must admit perhaps I was too rude when I was describing the glitches with IE8 Beta 2 usability. First of all, it was beta which purpose was to demonstrate new features and gather feedback, but no to present a completely finished product. Second, it were my own thoughts, but still IE remains the most popular browser on the Net and people must find it useable, since they use it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Internet Explorer 8 Release Candidate 1 is available now, which means that there won&rsquo;t be any new functionality in the release, however if they find any bugs in the current RC, they will fix them and make RC2 available for public.</p>
<p>So, if you want to submit any bug report of feature request, I strongly advice you take part in the Microsoft Connect program that allows you to send feedback about their beta products, including Windows Azure, Windows 7, IE8 and many other products. Just navigate your browser to <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">connect.microsoft.com</a>, sign-in with your Live ID and choose an appropriate program. It&rsquo;s advisable to search through the database before submitting your bug report or a suggestions, because it&rsquo;s likely that other people have already spotted that bug and complained about it or came up with the same feature request.</p>
<p>Participating in such programs and sending feedbacks allows Microsoft to make better products that you will like ;-)!</p>
