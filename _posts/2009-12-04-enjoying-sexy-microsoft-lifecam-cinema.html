<p>Recently I have received a nice present from Microsoft (yes, I do receive some cool stuff from them, since I&rsquo;m a Microsoft Student Partner) &ndash; a Microsoft webcam.</p>
<p>I must admit I&rsquo;m not an expert in web cameras, although I&rsquo;m using my laptop built-in webcam very intensively, since I&rsquo;m living in the UK now away from my parents who are in Russia and whom I call each day with Skype. Anyway, the video quality of my built-in web camera is
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
pretty awful, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that before, I mean there was a noise and the video at times wasn&rsquo;t very smooth, but I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that.</p>
<p>However, after unpacking and installing the Microsoft camera, I was simply blown away by the video quality. They claim this camera supports HD with 720p, but since I&rsquo;m not in the HDTV bandwagon, I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is, you&rsquo;d better ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about tis. Anyway, the quality is superb, moreover it supports different resolutions up to 1280x720. <!-- more --></p>
<p>Before (with my laptop built-in camera) the video looked like this:</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image_sb_1" src="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/EnjoyingSexyMicrosoftLifeCamCinema/03F2F383/image_sb_1.jpg" border="0" alt="image_sb_1" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>But now it looks like this :-):</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2009-12-04 19-12-50.751" src="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/EnjoyingSexyMicrosoftLifeCamCinema/13465592/20091204191250.751.jpg" border="0" alt="2009-12-04 19-12-50.751" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>Please, note I haven&rsquo;t adjusted any settings and the resolution is just 640x430.</p>
<p>Also, the camera has good auto-focusing, meaning that if you move around, back and forward it will automatically focus, to illustrate this feature, I placed a sheet of paper in front of my two cameras. I bet you can guess which image belongs to which camera.</p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image_sb_2" src="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/EnjoyingSexyMicrosoftLifeCamCinema/0AE2803B/image_sb_2.jpg" border="0" alt="image_sb_2" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2009-12-04 19-11-27.441" src="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/EnjoyingSexyMicrosoftLifeCamCinema/2FFFCAA7/20091204191127.441.jpg" border="0" alt="2009-12-04 19-11-27.441" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>Moreover, the came has a built-in microphone that appears to be even better than my cheap external Logitech mike.</p>
<p>The only glitch I have found so far is its fixing mechanism, I mean perhaps it fits perfectly regular displays, but I don&rsquo;t think the fix fits my laptop very well, although the camera fixed
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
on it, but I have a fear that it&rsquo;s not fixed firmly enough.</p>
