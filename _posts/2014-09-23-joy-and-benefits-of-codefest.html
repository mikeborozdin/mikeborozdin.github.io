<p>I have already <a href="http://ncredinburgh.com/blog/posts/information-sharing-in-software-development">blogged</a> about the ways to share expertise and knowledge inside your organisation However, there is one more way. That’s something we call a codefest or hackathon. Codefest is an opportunity to work for two days on any project you like using any technology of your choice. Also, it’s a chance to work with people you don’t have on your project. This blog post is available <a href="http://ncredinburgh.com/blog/posts/joy-and-benefits-of-codefest" target="_blank">on my company’s blog</a>.</p>
