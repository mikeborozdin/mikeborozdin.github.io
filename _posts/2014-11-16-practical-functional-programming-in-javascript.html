title: "Practical Functional Programming in JavaScript"

---
<p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language with rich functional programming capabilities. Functional programming does not have to be difficult or hugely theoretical. Quite the opposite &ndash; it can help you to solve the most common programming challenges in a more concise and elegant fashion.</p>  

<p>In this video I focus on working with arrays in JavaScript. Normally, when dealing with arrays a developer would write a for loop and mutate a variable or two. However, JavaScript already comes with functions, such as, <code>every()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>map()</code>, <code>reduce()</code>, etc. that help you to write better code for array operations. <!-- more -->.

<p>I also demonstrate how you can combine those functions together in order to encapsulate complex data operations . We analyse performance of some operations and show how certain issues can be solved by using 3rd party libraries, such as <a href="http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/">lazy.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js">Immutable.js</a> Finally, I illustrate how functional programming can become only better in EcmaScript 6.</p>
