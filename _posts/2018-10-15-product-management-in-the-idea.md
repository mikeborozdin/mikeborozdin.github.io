Elevator Pitch
====

A mobile app that helps to find places that do you favourite meal or drink the best. Unlike existing products (Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Yelp), you see ratings for meals & drinks, as opposed to the whole place.<!-- more -->

Product Vision Board
====

Additionally, I've created a Product Canvas that helps to define various aspects about the products - target groups, needs, etc. That's based on [the blog post by Roman Pichler](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-canvas/).

      Help to find best things in town (brownies, coffee, wine, dry cleaners)

      <strong>Target Groups:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Visitors who come into town and search for the best wine</li>
        <li>People about town who always want to know where the best coffee is</li>

      <strong>Needs:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding the best thing around me right now</li>
        <li>Finding the best thing (brownie, coffee) in town</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Product</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile app</li>
        <li>Unlike other apps it allows searching places by a thing (brownie, coffee, wine)</li>
        <li>
          When I search for ‘brownie’, I’ll see places list by the quality of brownies, 
          not by the overall quality
        </li>
        <li>Current products (Yelp, TripAdvisor, FourSquare) only show the overall rating</li>
        <ul>
          <li>But what does it mean for a cafe to be rated 4 stars?</li>
          <li>Does it mean that it’s got a 4 star coffee? Or a brownie? Or just a cozy interior?</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
