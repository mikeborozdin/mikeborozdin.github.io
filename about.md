Hi! My name is Mike Borozdin. I'm a software engineer / engineering manager with a strong customer and product focus. My firm belief is that technology is a key component of a successful business. 

I'm also passionate about empowering other people and evangelising technologies, products, and processes. I always seek an opportunity to share my knowledge either at work or a conference or through my blog.

While I might have personal preferences of tools, I’ve been using a big variety of different technology stacks, starting from .NET and Java to JavaScript and Python. Being exposed to a wide range of technologies not only allows you to choose the best tools for a job, but also broadens your mind and helps to see the same old stack in a different light.

Check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeborozdin/) for the detailed professional history.

Regarding my personal interests and hobbies, I’m very passionate about music, travelling, fitness, and food. I've lived in four different countries and I still keep exploring the world.

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:mike.borozdin@gmail.com) or follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mikeborozdin).
