	We live in desperate times. And more than ever we need to make decisions based on hard data and collaborate with each other.

So in the spirit of that, I’ve released an open source <a href="https://www.trackavirus.app/">COVID-19 Dashboard</a>.

	MobX is a statement management library. Unlike Redux it doesn’t require a lot of boilerplate code. In this post we’ll talk how you can benefit from using MobX vs Redux.

	<h1><a href="/post/gradual-typescript-migration">Gradual move to TypeScript. Running JavaScript and TypeScript side-by-side</a></h1>
	TypeScript has a lot of advantages. However, it’s not often that you are starting a brand new project. More often though you are working on an existing codebase and simply don’t have luxury of rewriting everything from scratch. After all, we need to deliver new features and fix annoying bugs. 

But we shouldn’t despair - it’s possible to gradually move your projects to TypeScript - one module at a time - and run TypeScript and JavaScript side-by-side.

	You have an idea for a B2C product, for a mobile app even. But you’re worried about bugs &amp; bad reviews on app store. So, you only release it for a very limited audience. That’s probably wrong…

	This post talks about setting a value hypothesis and related KPIs. It’s part of <a href="/product-management-in-the-open">the ‘Product Management in the Open’ series</a>. The goal of the series is describe the process of product managing a mobile app - Best in Town / Best in Edinburgh. Please, <a href="/product-management-in-the-open/idea">check this page to read more about the app itself</a>. 

This post describes my thinking back in the beginning of 2017. Not everything I did at that time was correct and I also try to reflect on some of the mistakes here.

A mobile app that helps to find places that do you favourite meal or drink the best. Unlike existing products (Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Yelp), you see ratings for meals &amp; drinks, as opposed to the whole place.

	<h1><a href="/post/split-user-stories-get-value-early">Split User Stories Ruthlessly - And Get Value Earlier</a></h1>
	Why do you need to split user stories?

Often, you hear that it is important to split user stories. You read articles that say it should be possible to complete a user story within a single sprint, ideally within a few days. That’s entirely accurate. 

<blockquote>
  But the main benefit of splitting user stories is that you will deliver value faster!

	<h1><a href="/post/writing-a-public-js-library-validate-your-arguments">Writing a JavaScript Public Library? Validate Your Arguments</a></h1>
	How many times have seen an obscure JavaScript error when using one 3rd party library or another? More likely than not, you’ve come across a message like:

<pre><code>TypeError: Cannot call method 'someMethod' of undefined
</code></pre>

Your browser or the Node.js interpreter will tell you in which file and on which line that error has occurred. Then, you’ll start a very mundane task of examining the code of a 3rd party library, if it’s has not been minimised, of course. Eventually, you will find out that you have forgotten to provide one of the arguments required by a function.
You may even see a more obscure error.
