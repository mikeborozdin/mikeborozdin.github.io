	<h1><a href="/post/managing-technical-debt">Managing technical debt</a></h1>
	Often engineering teams struggle with technical debt. They are busy with building features and fixing bugs, but that’s not going well due to a huge amount of technical debt. However, they hardly get any time to fix any of the debt.

In this article I’m going to share my experience on how to manage technical debt and get it fixed.

	<h1><a href="/post/being-effective-tech-lead">On being effective tech lead</a></h1>
	Tech Lead / Lead Developer / (Whatever it is called in your company) is a very interesting role that combines technical
work and leadership.

I’ve been in that role at a few different companies and I’d like to share my thoughts on what you can do to be effective in that role.

Equally, this article may also help you to decide if you want to try the role.

	We live in desperate times. And more than ever we need to make decisions based on hard data and collaborate with each other.

So in the spirit of that, I’ve released an open source <a href="https://www.trackavirus.app/">COVID-19 Dashboard</a>.

	MobX is a statement management library. Unlike Redux it doesn’t require a lot of boilerplate code. In this post we’ll talk how you can benefit from using MobX vs Redux.

	<h1><a href="/post/gradual-typescript-migration">Gradual move to TypeScript. Running JavaScript and TypeScript side-by-side</a></h1>
	TypeScript has a lot of advantages. However, it’s not often that you are starting a brand new project. More often though you are working on an existing codebase and simply don’t have luxury of rewriting everything from scratch. After all, we need to deliver new features and fix annoying bugs. 

But we shouldn’t despair - it’s possible to gradually move your projects to TypeScript - one module at a time - and run TypeScript and JavaScript side-by-side.

	You have an idea for a B2C product, for a mobile app even. But you’re worried about bugs &amp; bad reviews on app store. So, you only release it for a very limited audience. That’s probably wrong…

	This post talks about setting a value hypothesis and related KPIs. It’s part of <a href="/product-management-in-the-open">the ‘Product Management in the Open’ series</a>. The goal of the series is describe the process of product managing a mobile app - Best in Town / Best in Edinburgh. Please, <a href="/product-management-in-the-open/idea">check this page to read more about the app itself</a>. 

This post describes my thinking back in the beginning of 2017. Not everything I did at that time was correct and I also try to reflect on some of the mistakes here.
