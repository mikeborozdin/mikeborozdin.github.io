	WPF DataGrid has a very annoying behaviour of forcing users to click twice on a checkbox in order to check or uncheck it. There are a number of solutions proposing handling mouse preview events and switching a DataGrid into the edit mode manually. The problem with such solutions is that the require writing quite a lot of extra code that seems to be an overkill for such a minor, yet irritating problem. I propose a better option, to use a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">DataGridTemplateColumn</span> instead of <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">DataGridCheckBoxColumn</span>.
Indeed, you can easily place a CheckBox inside a DataGridTemplateColumn, bind it to a corresponding property and it will be checkable/uncheckable with a single click.

	Often you need to make a full copy of a database, for example, if you you want to change something and see how it goes without ruining a production database. And if you happen to use SQL Server Express edition you are not so fortunate because famous Copy Database Wizard does not seem to be unavailable in&nbsp; SQL Server Express Management Studio. There is a simply solution, however. It is using the backup and restore features.

	<h1><a href="/post/graphical-tools-for-sql-server-ce-40">Graphical Tools for SQL Server CE 4.0</a></h1>
	When I was writing my <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Introducing-SQL-Server-CE-40-CTP.aspx" target="_blank">introductory post</a> about the newly released version of SQL Server or more precisely about just a CTP (Community Technology Preview) version, I complained about an apparent lack of graphical tools similar to SQL Server Management Studio or at least similar to Visual Studio Server Explorer. Such a lack made an exploration of indeed promising features of SQL Server CE 4.0 a slightly tricky task. However, as I pointed out in my previous post that shouldn’t&#160; actually prevent programmers from playing with this database, because in spite of non-existence of GUI tools there was already an API released, thus it was possible to interact with the database system by just issuing SQL statements from C# or any other .NET language.  However, I was wrong in my statement about a lack of GUI tools, in fact they do exists.

	<ul>   <li>What SQL Server CE 4.0 means for ASP.NET developers</li>    <li>Where to get and how to install</li>    <li>How do I create my tables?!!</li> </ul>  When I came across a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/06/30/new-embedded-database-support-with-asp-net.aspx" target="_blank">story</a> on the newest version of SQL Server CE by Scott Guthrie, as well as a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlservercompact/archive/2010/07/07/introducing-sql-server-compact-4-0-the-next-gen-embedded-database-from-microsoft.aspx" target="_blank">blog post</a> in the SQL Server CE team blog, I was amazed that it was possible to run on a web server for ASP.NET application in the Medium Trust mode without any installation. This literally means that finally one can use SQL for storing data even though their hosting plan, for example, doesn’t allow having a SQL Server database.

	Facebook has recently released a new tool for accessing its vast amount of data. The name of the tool is the Graph API. The Graph API allows you to literally interact with any Facebook object, including users, their photos, posts, groups, pages, as well as connections between object, i.e. listing people&rsquo;s friends, group members and page fans, etc. Moreover, this interaction isn&rsquo;t only single-directional, in fact you can also modify object, add and delete them.

<li>You can become a successful developer without a degree </li>
<li>University broads your mind </li>
<li>What about a scientific career? </li>
<li>Students life is just fun</li>
</ul>
It&rsquo;s a popular and ranting debate whether one has to take a degree or not to become a successful programmer. One side of the debate always say that you can do without having a degree and people come up with examples of people who for some reason didn&rsquo;t obtain a degree but became quite successful.

	Design patterns are not a universal tool that can be applied to any project or be used with any programming language. Quality code can be produced without implementing any pattern or even without using OOP. One shouldn&rsquo;t think of their colleagues as of bad developers if they don&rsquo;t know the names of fancy design patterns. Moreover, not any single programming project is a business application.

	Recently I have received a nice present from Microsoft (yes, I do receive some cool stuff from them, since I&rsquo;m a Microsoft Student Partner) &ndash; a Microsoft webcam.
I must admit I&rsquo;m not an expert in web cameras, although I&rsquo;m using my laptop built-in webcam very intensively, since I&rsquo;m living in the UK now away from my parents who are in Russia and whom I call each day with Skype. Anyway, the video quality of my built-in web camera is
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
pretty awful, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that before, I mean there was a noise and the video at times wasn&rsquo;t very smooth, but I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that.
However, after unpacking and installing the Microsoft camera, I was simply blown away by the video quality. They claim this camera supports HD with 720p, but since I&rsquo;m not in the HDTV bandwagon, I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is, you&rsquo;d better ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about tis. Anyway, the quality is superb, moreover it supports different resolutions up to 1280x720.

	Finally, it has become possible to easily add AJAX file uploading capabilities to ASP.NET applications. The newly released version of the <a href="http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">AJAX Control Toolkit</a> ships with two new controls, one of them is called AsyncFileUpload control which was designed specially for the above mentioned purpose. It&rsquo;s really great that a new version of AJAX Control Toolkit has arrived, because the project seemed to be dead, especially since ASP.NET MVC had taken its place on the stage and many developers switched to it and to jQuery which can also be used with ASP.NET WebForms.
Anyway, it is the time to introduce the control for asynchronous file uploading.

	<h1><a href="/post/the-intelligent-blog-spam">The *Intelligent* Blog Spam</a></h1>
	Nowadays, the comment spam isn&rsquo;t those dumb messages that just used to contain an URL to scammers web site. Today, the comment spam is aimed to for SEO. Usually you receive a commentary that at first sight doesn&rsquo;t have anything suspicious, it may have just a couple of words or &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;, but if you look closer, you will notice that the URL field of the comment author is filled in and the web site doesn&rsquo;t have anything in common with the topic of your blog post. By doing this they are trying to increase the Google PageRank, so it&rsquo;s reasonable to add <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">rel=&rdquo;nofollow&rdquo; </span><span style="font-family: Ver;">to the URL field.</span> Of course, if it happens once, it may be a real man, but if you are always receive such comments, then it can be nothing else, but spam.
Moreover, such comments usually have some words and phrases that present in the original article, for instance I usually meet spam comments with &ldquo;ASP.NET&rdquo; or &ldquo;Internet Explorer&rdquo; in their text. But what amused me most of all is this particular comment:
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>&ldquo;</strong></span>ASP.NET has gone in unmanaged and unstable state where we have 100s of project coded in ASP.NET 2.0 and when we open them in 2008 nothing opens, upgrading to 3.5 are mere nightmares. And finally so many new technologies just to boost the marketing headlines. But come on guys, its easy for one blogger to just blog about able to mix technologies with writing 100s of lines of code which one geek can understand. Have you even worked on any project involving more then 5 developers? Practically we are spending more monty to train new things to our staff, more money to buy new tools, more money to manage projects and more and more money to sit and search world of forums to find why one thing doesnt work then actually doing simple development.<span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>&rdquo;</strong></span></span>
It is really hilarious, considering that fact that it was posted under article called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Is-PHPLinq-As-Cool-As-Real-LINQ.aspx">Is PHPLinq As Cool As Real LINQ?&rdquo;</a>.
