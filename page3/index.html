	<ul>
<li>You can become a successful developer without a degree </li>
<li>University broads your mind </li>
<li>What about a scientific career? </li>
<li>Students life is just fun</li>
</ul>
It&rsquo;s a popular and ranting debate whether one has to take a degree or not to become a successful programmer. One side of the debate always say that you can do without having a degree and people come up with examples of people who for some reason didn&rsquo;t obtain a degree but became quite successful.

	Design patterns are not a universal tool that can be applied to any project or be used with any programming language. Quality code can be produced without implementing any pattern or even without using OOP. One shouldn&rsquo;t think of their colleagues as of bad developers if they don&rsquo;t know the names of fancy design patterns. Moreover, not any single programming project is a business application.

	Recently I have received a nice present from Microsoft (yes, I do receive some cool stuff from them, since I&rsquo;m a Microsoft Student Partner) &ndash; a Microsoft webcam.
I must admit I&rsquo;m not an expert in web cameras, although I&rsquo;m using my laptop built-in webcam very intensively, since I&rsquo;m living in the UK now away from my parents who are in Russia and whom I call each day with Skype. Anyway, the video quality of my built-in web camera is
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
pretty awful, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that before, I mean there was a noise and the video at times wasn&rsquo;t very smooth, but I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that.
However, after unpacking and installing the Microsoft camera, I was simply blown away by the video quality. They claim this camera supports HD with 720p, but since I&rsquo;m not in the HDTV bandwagon, I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is, you&rsquo;d better ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about tis. Anyway, the quality is superb, moreover it supports different resolutions up to 1280x720.

	Finally, it has become possible to easily add AJAX file uploading capabilities to ASP.NET applications. The newly released version of the <a href="http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">AJAX Control Toolkit</a> ships with two new controls, one of them is called AsyncFileUpload control which was designed specially for the above mentioned purpose. It&rsquo;s really great that a new version of AJAX Control Toolkit has arrived, because the project seemed to be dead, especially since ASP.NET MVC had taken its place on the stage and many developers switched to it and to jQuery which can also be used with ASP.NET WebForms.
Anyway, it is the time to introduce the control for asynchronous file uploading.

	<h1><a href="/post/the-intelligent-blog-spam">The *Intelligent* Blog Spam</a></h1>
	Nowadays, the comment spam isn&rsquo;t those dumb messages that just used to contain an URL to scammers web site. Today, the comment spam is aimed to for SEO. Usually you receive a commentary that at first sight doesn&rsquo;t have anything suspicious, it may have just a couple of words or &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;, but if you look closer, you will notice that the URL field of the comment author is filled in and the web site doesn&rsquo;t have anything in common with the topic of your blog post. By doing this they are trying to increase the Google PageRank, so it&rsquo;s reasonable to add <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">rel=&rdquo;nofollow&rdquo; </span><span style="font-family: Ver;">to the URL field.</span> Of course, if it happens once, it may be a real man, but if you are always receive such comments, then it can be nothing else, but spam.
Moreover, such comments usually have some words and phrases that present in the original article, for instance I usually meet spam comments with &ldquo;ASP.NET&rdquo; or &ldquo;Internet Explorer&rdquo; in their text. But what amused me most of all is this particular comment:
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>&ldquo;</strong></span>ASP.NET has gone in unmanaged and unstable state where we have 100s of project coded in ASP.NET 2.0 and when we open them in 2008 nothing opens, upgrading to 3.5 are mere nightmares. And finally so many new technologies just to boost the marketing headlines. But come on guys, its easy for one blogger to just blog about able to mix technologies with writing 100s of lines of code which one geek can understand. Have you even worked on any project involving more then 5 developers? Practically we are spending more monty to train new things to our staff, more money to buy new tools, more money to manage projects and more and more money to sit and search world of forums to find why one thing doesnt work then actually doing simple development.<span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>&rdquo;</strong></span></span>
It is really hilarious, considering that fact that it was posted under article called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Is-PHPLinq-As-Cool-As-Real-LINQ.aspx">Is PHPLinq As Cool As Real LINQ?&rdquo;</a>.

	<h1><a href="/post/why-i-hate-pdf-as-an-e-book-format-or-pdf-vs-chm">Why I hate PDF as an E-book Format or PDF vs CHM</a></h1>
	PDF (Portable Document Format) is a common choice for e-books, big manuals comprising of several hundred pages and other documents. At a first glance, it seems to be a reasonable choice. PDF is a really cross-platform format, the most popular PDF viewer &ndash; Adobe Acrobat &ndash; is freely available in all popular operating systems &ndash; Windows, Mac OS and Linux. But what is wrong with it?
Well, the first of all, it tends to be slow, of course, it might depend on an application you are viewing your document with, but still opening large files in Adobe Acrobat doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy walk. Of course, it&rsquo;s not the only reason why I think this format is a poor choice for e-books.

	Recently I have been working on a project where I needed to make use of some geographical data and I decided to use Google Maps for that. So, in this particular tutorial I will explain how one can start working with the Google Maps API in ASP.NET.
Basically, the following topic will be covered:
<ul>
<li>How to find a place on the map by address </li>
<li>How to let a user choose a place on the map and retrieve its coordinates and save them in a database.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

	Recently I was looking for a free backup tool that would keep my important documents online and in case any problems with my laptop, I could easily recover them.
I could use my own hosting space, but I thought it wasn&rsquo;t convenient to manually upload the documents I was constantly working on. So, I decided to look for some automatic solution. Basically, I need the following things:
<ul>
<li>Ability to save the data online </li>
<li>Ability to perform automatic synchronization, i.e. when I change a file on my local computer it should get automatically updated on the remote storage and vice versa. </li>
</ul>

	<h1><a href="/post/put-entitydatasource-attributes-to-code-behind">Put EntityDataSource Attributes to Code-Behind</a></h1>
	The EntityDataSource control is a very powerful one. It allows you to rapidly create database driven application. You don&rsquo;t have to manually write code for extracting, modification and deleting records from the database. Moreover since this code is backed by Entity Framework, you are not tied up with a particular database schema and can easily change it or even choose other database application.
However when working with EntityDataSource sometimes I feel like I using plain old SqlDataSource and simply have too much unnecessary code in my .aspx files.

	<h1><a href="/post/css-class-names-instead-of-aspnet-client-ids">CSS Class Names Instead of ASP.NET Client IDs</a></h1>
	In ASP.NET the client IDs of controls are often really unpredictable. When you need to add some JavaScript code that works with rendered controls you have to know their IDs. But usually an ID looks like something like this: &ldquo;ctl00_contentBody_txtStreet&rdquo;. There are several methods for overcoming that diffic
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
ulty explained <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/4605.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. However they require writing additional code or even creating your own controls inherited from the original ones.
But there is one simply but yet dirty way of addressing HTML elements rendered by ASP.NET.
