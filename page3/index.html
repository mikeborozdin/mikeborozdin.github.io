	Facebook has recently released a new tool for accessing its vast amount of data. The name of the tool is the Graph API. The Graph API allows you to literally interact with any Facebook object, including users, their photos, posts, groups, pages, as well as connections between object, i.e. listing people&rsquo;s friends, group members and page fans, etc. Moreover, this interaction isn&rsquo;t only single-directional, in fact you can also modify object, add and delete them.

	Design patterns are not a universal tool that can be applied to any project or be used with any programming language. Quality code can be produced without implementing any pattern or even without using OOP. One shouldn&rsquo;t think of their colleagues as of bad developers if they don&rsquo;t know the names of fancy design patterns. Moreover, not any single programming project is a business application.

	Finally, it has become possible to easily add AJAX file uploading capabilities to ASP.NET applications. The newly released version of the <a href="http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">AJAX Control Toolkit</a> ships with two new controls, one of them is called AsyncFileUpload control which was designed specially for the above mentioned purpose. It&rsquo;s really great that a new version of AJAX Control Toolkit has arrived, because the project seemed to be dead, especially since ASP.NET MVC had taken its place on the stage and many developers switched to it and to jQuery which can also be used with ASP.NET WebForms.
Anyway, it is the time to introduce the control for asynchronous file uploading.

	Recently I have been working on a project where I needed to make use of some geographical data and I decided to use Google Maps for that. So, in this particular tutorial I will explain how one can start working with the Google Maps API in ASP.NET.
Basically, the following topic will be covered:
<ul>
<li>How to find a place on the map by address </li>
<li>How to let a user choose a place on the map and retrieve its coordinates and save them in a database.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

	Recently I was looking for a free backup tool that would keep my important documents online and in case any problems with my laptop, I could easily recover them.
I could use my own hosting space, but I thought it wasn&rsquo;t convenient to manually upload the documents I was constantly working on. So, I decided to look for some automatic solution. Basically, I need the following things:
<ul>
<li>Ability to save the data online </li>
<li>Ability to perform automatic synchronization, i.e. when I change a file on my local computer it should get automatically updated on the remote storage and vice versa. </li>
</ul>

	<h1><a href="/post/put-entitydatasource-attributes-to-code-behind">Put EntityDataSource Attributes to Code-Behind</a></h1>
	The EntityDataSource control is a very powerful one. It allows you to rapidly create database driven application. You don&rsquo;t have to manually write code for extracting, modification and deleting records from the database. Moreover since this code is backed by Entity Framework, you are not tied up with a particular database schema and can easily change it or even choose other database application.
However when working with EntityDataSource sometimes I feel like I using plain old SqlDataSource and simply have too much unnecessary code in my .aspx files.

	<h1><a href="/post/css-class-names-instead-of-aspnet-client-ids">CSS Class Names Instead of ASP.NET Client IDs</a></h1>
	In ASP.NET the client IDs of controls are often really unpredictable. When you need to add some JavaScript code that works with rendered controls you have to know their IDs. But usually an ID looks like something like this: &ldquo;ctl00_contentBody_txtStreet&rdquo;. There are several methods for overcoming that diffic
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
ulty explained <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/4605.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. However they require writing additional code or even creating your own controls inherited from the original ones.
But there is one simply but yet dirty way of addressing HTML elements rendered by ASP.NET.

	Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 is an indeed great application. But when it comes to adding a new e-mail account one can simply feel frustrated, simply because every message received from that account will still be stored in the default account. I remember I was having a hard time after switching from Mozilla Thunderbird to Outlook when adding my e-mail accounts.
Hopefully, there is a workaround

	Although I mostly blog about .NET and related technologies, tools, etc., this time I&rsquo;m writing about PHP. I work a lot with PHP as well. And recently I got a small project to do and I was looking for a free but cute PHP IDE. I&rsquo;m quite aware about Eclipse and PHP Development Tools for Eclipse, but I still was wondering if there is some other free tool for PHP. Eventually, I remembered <a href="http://www.netbeans.org" target="_blank">NetBeans</a>.
NetBeans is mostly known for Java developers as a good and free IDE. At the same time recently <a href="http://www.netbeans.org" target="_blank">NetBeans</a> started supporting other languages, like C/C++, Ruby and finally PHP. Moreover it not only supports plain PHP, but it offers quite good support of HTML and JavaScript.

	<h1><a href="/post/do-you-suffer-from-information-overload">Do You Suffer From Information Overload?</a></h1>
	Do you ever feel surrounded by tons of information that you think you don&rsquo;t have time to consume? I guess everyone remembers that feeling when you are glancing at your RSS reader and say to yourself: &ldquo;Jeez, that&rsquo;s really interesting, all that new development tools and useful refactoring patterns, but I don&rsquo;t really have time for that, I need to finish my project, cause the deadline is coming&rdquo;. In addition, there are also very interesting things that go around us, including Facebook updates from your friends, new photos from your Flickr pals and fresh tweets from your mates. In contrast to that *serious* news on software development, we always tend to read updates from our friends, moreover we become addicted to that kind of news, so we are constantly checking our e-mails, reply to instant messages and so on. In the mean time we still have to work and have normal rest away from the computer :)!
