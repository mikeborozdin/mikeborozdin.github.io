	I must admit perhaps I was too rude when I was describing the glitches with IE8 Beta 2 usability. First of all, it was beta which purpose was to demonstrate new features and gather feedback, but no to present a completely finished product. Second, it were my own thoughts, but still IE remains the most popular browser on the Net and people must find it useable, since they use it.
Anyway, Internet Explorer 8 Release Candidate 1 is available now, which means that there won&rsquo;t be any new functionality in the release, however if they find any bugs in the current RC, they will fix them and make RC2 available for public.
So, if you want to submit any bug report of feature request, I strongly advice you take part in the Microsoft Connect program that allows you to send feedback about their beta products, including Windows Azure, Windows 7, IE8 and many other products. Just navigate your browser to <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">connect.microsoft.com</a>, sign-in with your Live ID and choose an appropriate program. It&rsquo;s advisable to search through the database before submitting your bug report or a suggestions, because it&rsquo;s likely that other people have already spotted that bug and complained about it or came up with the same feature request.
Participating in such programs and sending feedbacks allows Microsoft to make better products that you will like ;-)!

	<h1><a href="/post/free-entity-framework-learning-guide">Free Entity Framework Learning Guide</a></h1>
	I came across a wonderful learning guide for the Entity Framework that explains many essential and complex things about the Entity Framework, including:
<ul>
<li>Modeling Entities </li>
<li>Lazy Loading </li>
<li>Inheritance </li>
<li>Working with objects </li>
<li>Performance </li>
<li>Working with Stored Procedures </li>
</ul>
Moreover this 500 pages long learning guide is absolutely free and can be downloaded <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/zeeshanhirani/archive/2008/12/18/my-christmas-present-to-the-entity-framework-community.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> with all examples.

	<h1><a href="/post/thoughts-on-internet-explorer-8-usability">Thoughts on Internet Explorer 8 Usability</a></h1>
	Well, Internet Explorer 8 is in the beta phase only, so it may be to early to judge it and make any conclusion. Anyway, I have some thoughts I want to share.
I&rsquo;ve been a long time Firefox user, even though I cannot say anything bad about IE, unlike some other people who always tend to whine about it, I was just used to Firefox, anyway, I decided to try IE 8 Beta 1 and now I&rsquo;m using Beta 2. It looked very promising to me. It passed the Acid2 Test, it has the Developers Tools and a built-in JavaScript debugger. So, Microsoft intends to release a more developer oriented browser that may surprise many web developers who have a bad opinion about Microsoft as a company that produced a very crappy browser and simply don&rsquo;t care much about web standards and web at all. It&rsquo;s not right, of course.

	LINQ to SQL and the Entity Framework are very powerful tools, however as in many other useful tools there are some things you should be aware of when working with them. One of those things is object attaching and detaching. Let&rsquo;s have a concrete example.
As you already know, you can retrieve an object from the database, update or remove it and all the necessary changes will be submitted to the database.
But what if you don&rsquo;t want to perform additional SELECT query? Instead, you want just to perform one necessary query, either to update an object or remove it.

	If you are using Microsoft SQL Server you don&rsquo;t experience any problems, SQL Server are supported by both LINQ to SQL and the Entity Framework. Frankly speaking, it couldn&rsquo;t be otherwise, since they all are made by Microsoft.
However, if you are using a non-Microsoft database engine, it&rsquo;s certainly
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
worth knowing if you can use LINQ to SQL or the Entity Framework with it. Moreover, it&rsquo;s always better if there is native support.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
I have already written several posts on the Entity Framework where I described the power of this particular ORM tool. I also mentioned the book on the Entity Framework written by a Microsoft MVP - Joydip Kanjila. This time I will publish an extract from the book that shows how you can build ASP.NET application by using the Entity Framework and the EntityDataSource control. It can also give a glimpse of the Entity Framework is, if you have no experience in it.
The tutorial covers the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Creating the Entity Data Model by using a graphical utility built-in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 </li>
<li>Creating the Entity Data Model by using a command line utility </li>
<li>Using the EntityDataSource ASP.NET control </li>
<li>Displaying the data in a GridView </li>
</ul>
This tutorial uses a particular database, but in fact you can use any database you already have.

	It&rsquo;s really sad, but true. Spammers hit trackbacks. Recently, you could prevent spam in comments by enforcing registration or adding a CAPTCHA or by simply enabling comment moderation. Now it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder. Spammers post trackbacks links that lead people to their scummy web sites, most of them are porn web sites. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think they are going to attract visitors to their web sites in this way, instead they are trying to increase their PageRank, I think.

	I suppose you have already heard about the Entity Framework, but probably didn&rsquo;t have a chance to try it in action. So, you want to learn it. Of course, you can start with MSDN that is indeed is the num

	<h1><a href="/post/visual-studio-2010-ctp-performance-tip">Visual Studio 2010 CTP Performance Tip</a></h1>
	Visual Studio 2010 CTP has been available for some time already. So, I guess many of you have already used a chance to give a new version of the famous IDE a try. If you haven&rsquo;t downloaded it, well I think it&rsquo;s quite sensible thing to get it. It&rsquo;s likely to be released at the end of the next year, so you will have a plenty of time to learn all the new features and become a real guru of .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010.
Anyway, the current CTP is shipped as a Virtual PC image that means you cannot expect it run ultra fast. Moreover, the Virtual PC image is packaged with a lot of things that you may need when experiencing the new IDE, I mean they included Team Foundation Server, SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, Office 2007 and Windows Sharepoint Services that are running by default. Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot and it consumes a lot of memory. But sometimes you don&rsquo;t need those things at all, for instance, you just want to learn the new features of C# 4.0. Thus, it&rsquo;s sensible to get rid of unnecessary services, you can always enable them later. So, go to <strong>Start &ndash;&gt; Administrative Tools &ndash;&gt; Services</strong> and simply stop and disable automatic running of the services you don&rsquo;t need.
Personally, I disabled TFS, SQL Server, WSS, IIS, Tablet Input services. Eventually the memory consumption of my virtual machine dropped from about 1 GB to less than 500 MBs.

	Well, it’s been a very long time since I posted anything. That’s certainly wrong. I must correct myself ;-)!  Anyway, I want to tell you that I had a great opportunity to visit a meeting of Microsoft Student Partners from Russia in my city. I must admit it was an incredible event. I met so many people who are really passionate about technology. They are eager to tell people about great technologies, as well! It’s a great think that we can gather all together and get to know each other :)! I must thank Microsoft for that :)!
