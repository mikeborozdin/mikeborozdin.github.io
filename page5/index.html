	Visual Studio 2010 CTP has been available for some time already. So, I guess many of you have already used a chance to give a new version of the famous IDE a try. If you haven&rsquo;t downloaded it, well I think it&rsquo;s quite sensible thing to get it. It&rsquo;s likely to be released at the end of the next year, so you will have a plenty of time to learn all the new features and become a real guru of .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010.
Anyway, the current CTP is shipped as a Virtual PC image that means you cannot expect it run ultra fast. Moreover, the Virtual PC image is packaged with a lot of things that you may need when experiencing the new IDE, I mean they included Team Foundation Server, SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, Office 2007 and Windows Sharepoint Services that are running by default. Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot and it consumes a lot of memory. But sometimes you don&rsquo;t need those things at all, for instance, you just want to learn the new features of C# 4.0. Thus, it&rsquo;s sensible to get rid of unnecessary services, you can always enable them later. So, go to <strong>Start &ndash;&gt; Administrative Tools &ndash;&gt; Services</strong> and simply stop and disable automatic running of the services you don&rsquo;t need.
Personally, I disabled TFS, SQL Server, WSS, IIS, Tablet Input services. Eventually the memory consumption of my virtual machine dropped from about 1 GB to less than 500 MBs.

	Well, it’s been a very long time since I posted anything. That’s certainly wrong. I must correct myself ;-)!  Anyway, I want to tell you that I had a great opportunity to visit a meeting of Microsoft Student Partners from Russia in my city. I must admit it was an incredible event. I met so many people who are really passionate about technology. They are eager to tell people about great technologies, as well! It’s a great think that we can gather all together and get to know each other :)! I must thank Microsoft for that :)!

	Well, I apologize for not posting anything for such a long time. Anyway, I’m happy to announce that I’ve become a Microsoft Student Partner. I took an active part in the Microsoft User Group in my university that was organized by other Student Partners. I decided to apply for this program and my application was accepted.  Now I’m responsible for organization of student IT events related to Microsoft products. It’s very challenging and interesting activity. And I’m happy with it now.   You can learn more about this program on this <a target="_blank" href="http://student-partners.com/">web site</a>, you can also apply for it there.

	<h1><a href="/post/data-manipulations-with-entity-framework">Data Manipulations with Entity Framework</a></h1>
	When learning a new ORM one of the most important and interesting thing is to get to know how you can manipulate data with that tool.Thus, this particular thing is explained in this tutorial.
There are two ways of accessing data with the Entity Framework:
<ul>
<li>Entity SQL </li>
<li>LINQ to SQL </li>
</ul>
We will be using the latter in this tutorial.

	<h1><a href="/post/getting-intrigued-by-entity-framework">Getting Intrigued by Entity Framework</a></h1>
	If you use LINQ to SQL, you may wonder why Microsoft released yet another ORM (Entity Framework), while they already had one. You may also be confused, because it&rsquo;s not obvious which one to choose. Anyway, the Entity Framework has its own shiny features that don&rsquo;t present in LINQ to SQL. Besides, you can still use LINQ to retrieve data with the Entity Framework, in this case, it&rsquo;s called LINQ to Entities, at the same time you can also use a SQL like language &ndash; Entities SQL. In this story I&rsquo;ll show one particular feature of Entity Framework that certainly must interest many developers.
Basicall
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
y, Entity Framework provides a higher level of abstraction than LINQ to SQL. In fact, in hides the data level. So, you deal with objects that represent real entities, not database tables, like if you were using LINQ to SQL. I mean when you generate LINQ to SQL classes, it creates classes for each tables, even though those tables are merely junction tables without any reflection in our real life.
Let&rsquo;s have a look at the example, to make things clear.

	<h1><a href="/post/entity-framework-and-mysql">Entity Framework and MySQL</a></h1>
	Although MySQL don't seem to be very interested in providing a native support for LINQ to MySQL and you have to use 3-rd party providers to interact with MySQL by using LINQ, they seem to move towards Entity Framework. They are holding a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-204.html">webinar about using Entity Framework with MySQL</a> on September, 30.   I think this can be a one reason of many why it's worth using Entity Framework, the support by database vendors is a great thing. It is not the only reason, of course, there are many other ones. The main thing is that Entity Framework provides a higher level of abstraction than LINQ to SQL, for instance. It can be a topic for a series of articles, so I think, I'll cover Entity Framework in other articles.

	<h1><a href="/post/develop-php-in-visual-studio">Develop PHP in Visual Studio</a></h1>
	I've been programming with PHP for many years and have used a lot of editors and so-called IDEs, I must admit that PHP IDEs have become much better now and they differ significantly from simple editors with syntax highlighting. Anyway, in the recent time I have been working much with Visual Studio. I must confess that I really love it, some people may argue of course, especially Java developers who are fond of their development tools and tend to look down at other ones. So, I was happy to learn that there is a plug-in that enables you to program with PHP in a familiar development environment of Visual Studio. Sure, I doubt that it will interest people who don't have Visual Studio, but for developer who are used to it, it's a great choice, I think.

	Even though I don't program with C++ much these days, I still love the book entitled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">C++ Programming Language</a>" by Bjarne Stroustrup - the creator of the C++ programming language. Its first edition was published in 1986, but the book still remains informative even for non-C++ programmers.&nbsp; Unlike many other programming books, this one doesn't focus only on the language itself,&nbsp; in contrast, there are many very useful chapters on various programming paradigms, including the object oriented one, for sure. Besides, it does really explain the p

urpose of the object oriented method and its benefits. Moreover, there is information on software architecture, class design and on programming process as a whole.

	There is a preview version only, but the release version will come soon, I think it looks very promising.
Here is a quote from their blog:
<em>Microsoft is opening up the </em><a href="http://www.msdn.com/"><em>MSDN</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.technet.com/"><em>TechNet</em></a><em>, and </em><a href="http://expression.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"><em>Expression </em></a><em>sites to the community, so that technical professionals can better connect with each other, share knowledge, and succeed. Tagging - and especially social bookmarking - are essential ingredients for making this happen.</em>

	<a href="/files/AdRotator.zip"><strong>Download files</strong></a>
Although there is a built-in control for advertisement rotation in ASP.NET, it is capable of showing image ads only. However, in the real life you often have to deal with the ads that require some JavaScript code, for instance, you want to put there AdSense code or want to use Flash banners instead of images. Thus, if you want to rotate complex ads, you have to develop your own control.
In this particular tutorial I'll show you how to create a very simple, but rather functional user control that will randomly show an ad from an XML file
