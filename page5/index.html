	If you use LINQ to SQL, you may wonder why Microsoft released yet another ORM (Entity Framework), while they already had one. You may also be confused, because it&rsquo;s not obvious which one to choose. Anyway, the Entity Framework has its own shiny features that don&rsquo;t present in LINQ to SQL. Besides, you can still use LINQ to retrieve data with the Entity Framework, in this case, it&rsquo;s called LINQ to Entities, at the same time you can also use a SQL like language &ndash; Entities SQL. In this story I&rsquo;ll show one particular feature of Entity Framework that certainly must interest many developers.
Basicall

y, Entity Framework provides a higher level of abstraction than LINQ to SQL. In fact, in hides the data level. So, you deal with objects that represent real entities, not database tables, like if you were using LINQ to SQL. I mean when you generate LINQ to SQL classes, it creates classes for each tables, even though those tables are merely junction tables without any reflection in our real life.
Let&rsquo;s have a look at the example, to make things clear.

	<h1><a href="/post/entity-framework-and-mysql">Entity Framework and MySQL</a></h1>
	Although MySQL don't seem to be very interested in providing a native support for LINQ to MySQL and you have to use 3-rd party providers to interact with MySQL by using LINQ, they seem to move towards Entity Framework. They are holding a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-204.html">webinar about using Entity Framework with MySQL</a> on September, 30.   I think this can be a one reason of many why it's worth using Entity Framework, the support by database vendors is a great thing. It is not the only reason, of course, there are many other ones. The main thing is that Entity Framework provides a higher level of abstraction than LINQ to SQL, for instance. It can be a topic for a series of articles, so I think, I'll cover Entity Framework in other articles.

	<h1><a href="/post/develop-php-in-visual-studio">Develop PHP in Visual Studio</a></h1>
	I've been programming with PHP for many years and have used a lot of editors and so-called IDEs, I must admit that PHP IDEs have become much better now and they differ significantly from simple editors with syntax highlighting. Anyway, in the recent time I have been working much with Visual Studio. I must confess that I really love it, some people may argue of course, especially Java developers who are fond of their development tools and tend to look down at other ones. So, I was happy to learn that there is a plug-in that enables you to program with PHP in a familiar development environment of Visual Studio. Sure, I doubt that it will interest people who don't have Visual Studio, but for developer who are used to it, it's a great choice, I think.

	Even though I don't program with C++ much these days, I still love the book entitled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">C++ Programming Language</a>" by Bjarne Stroustrup - the creator of the C++ programming language. Its first edition was published in 1986, but the book still remains informative even for non-C++ programmers.&nbsp; Unlike many other programming books, this one doesn't focus only on the language itself,&nbsp; in contrast, there are many very useful chapters on various programming paradigms, including the object oriented one, for sure. Besides, it does really explain the p

urpose of the object oriented method and its benefits. Moreover, there is information on software architecture, class design and on programming process as a whole.

Here is a quote from their blog:

	<a href="/files/AdRotator.zip"><strong>Download files</strong></a>
Although there is a built-in control for advertisement rotation in ASP.NET, it is capable of showing image ads only. However, in the real life you often have to deal with the ads that require some JavaScript code, for instance, you want to put there AdSense code or want to use Flash banners instead of images. Thus, if you want to rotate complex ads, you have to develop your own control.
In this particular tutorial I'll show you how to create a very simple, but rather functional user control that will randomly show an ad from an XML file

I won't argue whether ASP.NET is better than PHP (or Ruby on Rails) or not, instead I'll try to bust those myths.

	I want to proceed with telling how to deal with uploaded images with ASP.NET. I have already showed how to resize images. However, that resizing method isn't perfect. It doesn't produce images of high quality. Even though it just shrinks images, the quality of resized images don't match the quality of original images, the produced quality usually appears to be worse. Sure, there is a neat solution. We just need to use the <strong>HighQualityB

icubic</strong> <strong>Interpolation mode</strong>. Sounds difficult? In fact, it's not difficult to implement, just need to add a few lines of code,&nbsp; but the result is great.

	In the <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx" target="_blan&lt;mce:script type=">previous tutorial</a> I showed how to handle image uploads, how to validate some things and finally how to resize images retaining their proportions. This time I'll show you how to prevent uploading of files which size exceeds the defined limit. Well, this is not difficult to implement,&nbsp; however there are some pitfalls I'll tell you about later.

	I apologize, there were few mistakes in the <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article on ASP.NET Image Uploading</a>. There was a logic error in the resizing method. Furthermore, I decided to use the &lt;asp:FileUpload /&gt; control instead of the HTML input, FileUpload automatically adds a proper encryption type to the form.  The <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article</a> is still available by its <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">previous URL</a>, but now it's correct, as well as the project files.
