	Even though I don't program with C++ much these days, I still love the book entitled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201700735" target="_blank">C++ Programming Language</a>" by Bjarne Stroustrup - the creator of the C++ programming language. Its first edition was published in 1986, but the book still remains informative even for non-C++ programmers.&nbsp; Unlike many other programming books, this one doesn't focus only on the language itself,&nbsp; in contrast, there are many very useful chapters on various programming paradigms, including the object oriented one, for sure. Besides, it does really explain the p

urpose of the object oriented method and its benefits. Moreover, there is information on software architecture, class design and on programming process as a whole.

	There is a preview version only, but the release version will come soon, I think it looks very promising.
Here is a quote from their blog:

	<a href="/files/AdRotator.zip"><strong>Download files</strong></a>
Although there is a built-in control for advertisement rotation in ASP.NET, it is capable of showing image ads only. However, in the real life you often have to deal with the ads that require some JavaScript code, for instance, you want to put there AdSense code or want to use Flash banners instead of images. Thus, if you want to rotate complex ads, you have to develop your own control.
In this particular tutorial I'll show you how to create a very simple, but rather functional user control that will randomly show an ad from an XML file

I won't argue whether ASP.NET is better than PHP (or Ruby on Rails) or not, instead I'll try to bust those myths.

	<h1><a href="/post/high-quality-image-resizing-with-net">High Quality Image Resizing with .NET</a></h1>
	I want to proceed with telling how to deal with uploaded images with ASP.NET. I have already showed how to resize images. However, that resizing method isn't perfect. It doesn't produce images of high quality. Even though it just shrinks images, the quality of resized images don't match the quality of original images, the produced quality usually appears to be worse. Sure, there is a neat solution. We just need to use the <strong>HighQualityB

icubic</strong> <strong>Interpolation mode</strong>. Sounds difficult? In fact, it's not difficult to implement, just need to add a few lines of code,&nbsp; but the result is great.

	In the <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx" target="_blan&lt;mce:script type=">previous tutorial</a> I showed how to handle image uploads, how to validate some things and finally how to resize images retaining their proportions. This time I'll show you how to prevent uploading of files which size exceeds the defined limit. Well, this is not difficult to implement,&nbsp; however there are some pitfalls I'll tell you about later.

	I apologize, there were few mistakes in the <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article on ASP.NET Image Uploading</a>. There was a logic error in the resizing method. Furthermore, I decided to use the &lt;asp:FileUpload /&gt; control instead of the HTML input, FileUpload automatically adds a proper encryption type to the form.  The <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">article</a> is still available by its <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/ASPNET-Image-Uploading-(part-I).aspx">previous URL</a>, but now it's correct, as well as the project files.

	I was badly surprised today, when Visual Studio 2008 SP1 suddenly quit while loading the &quot;Choose Toolbox Items&quot; dialog. After some Googling I learnt that such things were caused by PowerCommands, thanks to the guys <a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1222006/2570275.aspx">here</a>. However, the workaround is pretty simply, you just have to re-install PowerCommands. After that procedure Visual Studio starts working properly again.

	<a href="/files/ImageUploading.zip"><strong>Download files</strong></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Is image uploading different from simply file uploading? No, but when creating an image uploading functionality you usually have to perform more operation, than if you application were to receive text files only. Basically, when making an image uploading form, you have to implement the following things:
<ul>
<li>Check if a file is uploaded </li>
<li>Check if the uploaded file is an image </li>
<li>Check if the uploaded file doesn't exceed a certain size </li>
<li>Resize the uploaded images without changing the proportions of the picture </li>
<li>Save the image </li>
</ul>
In this particular tutorial, I'll tell you how to perform the 3 operations, while I'll explain how to check the file size in the next part.

	As you may already know, it is required to create a web service to make use of some ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit controls. However, you can use static methods of your pages instead, you just have to mark them with the <strong>[System.Web.Services.WebMethod]</strong> attribute and not set the <strong>ServicePath</strong> parameter in the ACT controls.
