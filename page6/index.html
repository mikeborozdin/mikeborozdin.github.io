	I was badly surprised today, when Visual Studio 2008 SP1 suddenly quit while loading the &quot;Choose Toolbox Items&quot; dialog. After some Googling I learnt that such things were caused by PowerCommands, thanks to the guys <a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1222006/2570275.aspx">here</a>. However, the workaround is pretty simply, you just have to re-install PowerCommands. After that procedure Visual Studio starts working properly again.

	<h1><a href="/post/aspnet-image-uploading-(part-i)">ASP.NET Image Uploading (part I)</a></h1>
	<a href="/files/ImageUploading.zip"><strong>Download files</strong></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Is image uploading different from simply file uploading? No, but when creating an image uploading functionality you usually have to perform more operation, than if you application were to receive text files only. Basically, when making an image uploading form, you have to implement the following things:
<ul>
<li>Check if a file is uploaded </li>
<li>Check if the uploaded file is an image </li>
<li>Check if the uploaded file doesn't exceed a certain size </li>
<li>Resize the uploaded images without changing the proportions of the picture </li>
<li>Save the image </li>
</ul>
In this particular tutorial, I'll tell you how to perform the 3 operations, while I'll explain how to check the file size in the next part.

	As you may already know, it is required to create a web service to make use of some ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit controls. However, you can use static methods of your pages instead, you just have to mark them with the <strong>[System.Web.Services.WebMethod]</strong> attribute and not set the <strong>ServicePath</strong> parameter in the ACT controls.

	<h1><a href="/post/aspx-extension-instead-of-php-why">.aspx extension instead of .php? WHY???</a></h1>
	This story is not a debate on "ASP.NET vs PHP", but this story is about the people who develop their web applications with PHP, but pretend that they are using ASP.NET. Yes, such people do really exist. I came across their posts in the forums, where they said that or asked how to change the extension of PHP scripts to .aspx.
Why on Earth are they doing that?

	<strong><a href="/files/CascadingDropDown.zip">Download the project files</a></strong>
Creating dependant drop-down lists is a very common task, for example, when making a registration form, you usually have to add a country and a state fields, the contents of the state drop-down depends on the selected item in the country drop down field. Actually, it's not so difficult to implement that with the standard controls of ASP.NET. However if you don't want the page to be reloaded every time a user selects a value in the drop-down list, you should make use of AJAX. While you can use UpdatePanel for this task, it will be difficult if you have 3 or even linked drop-downs. Hopefully, you don't have to add a lot of UpdatePanels, instead you can pick up the CascadingDropDown Control from <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/" target="_blank">ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit</a>.

	<a href="/files/TreeViewWithCheckBoxes.zip" target="_blank"><strong>Download</strong></a><strong> the project files.</strong>
Although the TreeView control is a very powerful one, there are some pitfalls that you can run into when using it. One of the most popular problem is using checkboxes in TreeView. Despite the fact that you can enable checkboxes by setting <strong>ShowCheckBoxes="All"</strong> you still have to write a lot of JavaScript code to make it work properly. The problems are:
<ul>
<li>When you check a parent or a branch node the child nodes don't get checked </li>
<li>TreeView doesn't generate &lt;label&gt; tags around the nodes text, so when user click on the text next to the checkbox, the latter don't get checked </li>
</ul>
My solution written with JavaScript and with the help of ASP.NET AJAX library (so, don't forget to put a <strong>ScriptManager </strong>to your page) solves both problems. <strong>You can view the demo </strong><a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/demos/TreeViewWithCheckBoxes/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It was tested in IE, Firefox, Safari and Opera.

	Everybody knows the benefits of the open source software. Of course, the main benefit is the availability of the source code and the licence that allows us to perform he modifications and to distribute the derived product. The availability of the source code makes us think that the source code should be perfect. However this is not always true.

	I have already <a href="/post/Dzone-Instead-Of-Digg.aspx" target="_blank">said</a> that I love <a href="http://www.dzone.com/" target="_blank">DZone</a>, but I want to say more - I was really happy to discover another lovely feature of DZone - <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com" target="_blank">Refcardz</a>. Refcardz are basically reference cards on development topics available to download for free for DZone members, if you are not a DZone member, then you can register for free.
The reference card are in PDF and ready to be printed. They must be kept near your desk because if you need a quick reference, Refcardz will always help you. I believe the Refcardz on jQuery Selectors and Windows PowerShell will be useful for many people.
The current Refcardz are mostly on Java, RIA and AJAX, as well as on the general programming principles.

	I guess it's not a secret to anyone that many people complain about Vista, they simply hate it, they post negative comments on the web forums and so on. But are those complaints reasonable? These thing started to happen not after the Vista release, but some time before that! So, when Vista finally came out, it already had a negative image and it still has, no matter if it's a really good operating system. For instance, I know some people who are going to buy a laptop but they are scared to death by Vista, that sounds ridiculous and even stupid, but that's a fact. They don't want to have Windows Vista installed on their laptop instead they are trying to find one with XP installed.

	Although Windows Live Writer is a great tool that simplifies the life of every blogger it doesn't has all the needed features by default. Hopefully there are many plug-ins that can be found in the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8" target="_blank">gallery</a>. If you write about programming that you must be particularly interested in the plug-ins that allows you to paste formatted code snipped, links to MSDN and some other things. I decided to make a categorized list of such plug-ins.
