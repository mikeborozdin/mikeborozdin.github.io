	Everybody knows the benefits of the open source software. Of course, the main benefit is the availability of the source code and the licence that allows us to perform he modifications and to distribute the derived product. The availability of the source code makes us think that the source code should be perfect. However this is not always true.

	I have already <a href="/post/Dzone-Instead-Of-Digg.aspx" target="_blank">said</a> that I love <a href="http://www.dzone.com/" target="_blank">DZone</a>, but I want to say more - I was really happy to discover another lovely feature of DZone - <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com" target="_blank">Refcardz</a>. Refcardz are basically reference cards on development topics available to download for free for DZone members, if you are not a DZone member, then you can register for free.
The reference card are in PDF and ready to be printed. They must be kept near your desk because if you need a quick reference, Refcardz will always help you. I believe the Refcardz on jQuery Selectors and Windows PowerShell will be useful for many people.
The current Refcardz are mostly on Java, RIA and AJAX, as well as on the general programming principles.

	<h1><a href="/post/is-microsoft-losing-publicity-war">Is Microsoft Losing Publicity War?</a></h1>
	I guess it's not a secret to anyone that many people complain about Vista, they simply hate it, they post negative comments on the web forums and so on. But are those complaints reasonable? These thing started to happen not after the Vista release, but some time before that! So, when Vista finally came out, it already had a negative image and it still has, no matter if it's a really good operating system. For instance, I know some people who are going to buy a laptop but they are scared to death by Vista, that sounds ridiculous and even stupid, but that's a fact. They don't want to have Windows Vista installed on their laptop instead they are trying to find one with XP installed.

	Although Windows Live Writer is a great tool that simplifies the life of every blogger it doesn't has all the needed features by default. Hopefully there are many plug-ins that can be found in the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8" target="_blank">gallery</a>. If you write about programming that you must be particularly interested in the plug-ins that allows you to paste formatted code snipped, links to MSDN and some other things. I decided to make a categorized list of such plug-ins.

	In the previous articles I wrote about how to use the extender controls available in ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit, how to process them on the server, validate the data. It mainly dealt with a server-side part. Today, I'll show you how to add client-side events to the extender controls.

	In <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Building-Rich-Internet-Applications-With-ASPNET-AJAX-Control-Toolkit.aspx" target="_blank">the previous article</a> I told you about ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit, I explained its purpose, listed the available controls and showed an example. However, I think some things should be explained a bit more detailed. Today I'm going to talk about the extenders controls, I already mentioned them in <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Building-Rich-Internet-Applications-With-ASPNET-AJAX-Control-Toolkit.aspx" target="_blank">the previous article</a>, but I can repeat. An extender is a control that is a based on an ASP.NET web control, but provides an additional client-side functionality. Slider is a good example of an extender, in looks like a real sliding control in desktop applications, but in fact it just extends the TextBox control.

	<h1><a href="/post/aspnet-books">Recommended Advanced ASP.NET Books</a></h1>
	
I often see questions in the forums regarding ASP.NET books, usually people ask not only about reference style books, but about more advanced books that explain not only ASP.NET basics but teach you to write real world applications.


I know a really good book on that topic. This book focuses on building a web portal including news system, guest book, user registration, e-shop and many other features. Actually, this portal is a popular starter-kit called &quot;E-commerce starter-kit&quot; or &quot;The Beer House&quot; that you can find <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/starter-kits/the-beer-house/" target="_blank">here</a>.


The book is called &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764584642?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764584642" target="_blank">ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming: Problem - Design - Solution</a>&quot;. 


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470187581?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikborsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470187581" target="_blank">The new edition that describes ASP.NET 3.5</a> including LINQ and ASP.NET AJAX will soon arrive.


So, the books are highly recommended by many professional ASP.NET developers.

	<h1><a href="/post/building-rich-internet-applications-with-aspnet-ajax-control-toolkit">Building Rich Internet Applications With ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit</a></h1>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
Nowadays web isn't a web as it was 10 years ago. Web isn't a collection of static pages anymore. Actually, there was JavaScript and DHTML, but still web sites were far behind desktop applications in terms of interactivity. After the invention of AJAX it became possible to build really interactive web applications
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
that are nearly the same as desktop applications except they are run in a browser.
Writing AJAX JavaScript code is a pretty routine task, so it's sensible to use a library that already has the necessary functionality. While Visual Studio 2008 has built-in ASP.NET AJAX 1.0 library, it doesn't contain many useful things we need when we are writing rich Internet applications.
<h1>ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit</h1>
ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit or simply ACT is a thing that can help to write rich Internet applications. Basically, it's set a of useful interactive web controls that we usually find in desktop applications, but missing in web applications. These controls include sliders, pop-up calendars, modal dialogs and many others. We don't have to write any JavaScript code to use them in our applications, we just need to use ACT controls that are very similar to ordinary ASP.NET controls.
ACT is run both by Microsoft and community, so everybody can take part in the creation of the decent AJAX toolkit.

	<h1><a href="/post/windows-live-writer-simplifies-your-blogging">Windows Live Writer Simplifies Your Blogging</a></h1>
	
Finally, I have installed <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> and got amazed by its features. It does really simplify your blogging and save your time. With Live Writer you don&#39;t have to write a post in Word and then paste it to your blog, sometimes you even have to paste it to a another editor in order to get rid of Word text formatting. Now you don&#39;t have to do that.

  

Windows Live Writer supports many blogging platform, from Live Spaces to BlogEngine.NET and WordPress

  

Windows Live Writer has a built-in spell checker, so you don&#39;t need Word to check your spelling, it has nice formatting features, it supports different plug-in, so you can get a syntax highlighter, which is not available by default unfortunately.&nbsp; 

  

You can preview your posts, post preview is integrated into your blog design that looks awesome.

  

The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that it&#39;s not very obvious how to add new tags, because when your click the &quot;TAG&quot; button it only lists the existing tags, you can add new ones in the &quot;Keywords field in the properties section.

	If you have a blog, then you want to promote it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are motivated by money or by recognition.&nbsp; It you release your writings to public, then you want people to read them. Nowadays one of the most popular promotion techniques is sending links to social bookmarking web sites. The most popular social bookmarking web site is <a href="http://www.digg.com/" target="_blank">Digg.com</a>. But does Digg work perfectly for every blog? I mean, can you promote every blog with Digg?
