	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition</a> is an embeded database that allows you to integrate it in your destkop and mobile applications. It can be used in a variety of scenarios, just some examples:
<ul>
<li>a single-user application that still stores its data in the SQL database</li>
<li>a local cache of a remote SQL Server database,</li>
<li>a mobile application that synchronizes its local compact database with a remote database from time to time.</li>
</ul>
SQL Server Compact Edition takes about 1.5 MB on HDD and consumes about 5 MB of RAM. It&rsquo;s free to use and free to distribute with your application.

	As you may notice I don&rsquo;t use categories in my blog, only tags. Whether it&rsquo;s good or bad &ndash; is a matter of another topic.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m going to talk about how to make the archive work properly if you don&rsquo;t have any categories, because it doesn&rsquo;t display any posts unless they are filed under some category. I hope this will be fixed in the next versions, but you can fix it yourself, it&rsquo;s not difficult.

	I read about the PHP Implementation of LINQ called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPLinq" target="_blank">PHPLinq</a>. Frankly, I was sceptical about it. Finally, I gave it a try. I still remain sceptical...
<br /> Let&rsquo;s me explain why. Take a look at this fairly simple example

	I remember a moment that happened some weeks ago when Google was unavailable to me. I needed to search for something, but I couldn&rsquo;t reach Google. I could visit other web sites, but not Google. I asked my friends if Google was working for them, some of them told me that it was working, while other ones said that it wasn&rsquo;t working for them either. In a few minutes it started working again. So, I suppose it was a temporary problem with my ISP, probably some DNS problems.
<br /> But I swear it was such a frustrating moment!

	Have you ever faced a situation when you need to manipulate Excel spreadsheets with PHP on the server that is running Linux? If you had a Windows Server you could use PHP COM extensions. However they are unavailable on Linux.
<br /> Hopefully, there is a solution. It is called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338205.aspx" target="_blank">Open XML</a>. It&rsquo;s a new format of Microsoft Office documents introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. Basically, an Open XML file is a ZIP archive that contains XML files that represent the document mark-up. You can view it yourself or read some documentation, my article isn&rsquo;t about Open XML, but about the PHP library for working with Excel 2007 files. It also supports Excel 97 format by incor
<script src="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
porating a PEAR library.
<br /> The library is called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a>. It allows you to read/write Excel spreadsheets, save them in many formats including PDF and HTML. It supports formulas,styles and etc.

	Do you remember your first experience of using a computer? It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was DOS with Norton Commander or Windows. Anyway you had to learn how to find the necessary applications, how to execute them, once again it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you clicked on the folders and files on the blue background or used the Start menu. It&rsquo;s important that you learnt the definitions or metaphors; you learnt that icon is an application or something else; you learnt that you have to click twice on it to open it and so on.
<br /> Having got used to those metaphors, we easily use a computer unless we face an application with a non-standard interface that confuses us because we have to learn again.

	In the article called "<a href="/post/Getting-BlogEngineNET-To-Work-With-The-Local-Time-Zones.aspx" target="_blank">Getting BlogEngine.NET To Work With The Local Time Zones</a>" I described how to convert the times of the posts to the local time zones of users relying solely on JavaScript. However I got a complaint that if JavaScript is disabled for some reasons, then no date and time are displayed.

	<h1><a href="/post/linq-to-mysql">LINQ To MySQL</a></h1>
	LINQ to SQL is a great tool that saves a lot of time. However it has one disadvantage &ndash; it supports only SQL Server. Anyway it&rsquo;s possible to write your own LINQ provider. Sure, there is one for MySQL. It is called <a href="http://code2code.net/DB_Linq/" target="_blank">DbLinq</a>, in fact in supports many databases:
<ul>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>PostreSql</li>
<li>Ingress</li>
<li>SqlLite</li>
</ul>
It&rsquo;s not finished yet, however you can still try to use it. I&rsquo;m going to explain how to use it in this article; we&rsquo;ll go through 3 steps:
<ol>
<li>Installation</li>
<li>Using DbLinq in a console application</li>
<li>Using DbLinq in a ASP.NET application</li>
</ol>

	<h1><a href="/post/users-never-read-manuals">Users Never Read Manuals</a></h1>
	I was in the store the other day paying for my mobile phone. There was a middle-aged woman in front of me who was trying to pay for her mobile phone with the payment machine. This payment machine was recently installed, so it was difficult for some people to get used to it. Even I saw the machine for the first time. Anyway that woman was nervously trying to pay, however she even couldn&rsquo;t go further than entering her phone number, since I hadn&rsquo;t any experience with that machine as well, I advised her to read the manual that was under the button in the bottom of the screen. She got angry when she heard my advice. Then I noticed that she just didn&rsquo;t fill in the region code, I told her about that, she didn&rsquo;t listen, got angry and went away.
