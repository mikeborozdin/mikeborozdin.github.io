Finally, I have installed <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> and got amazed by its features. It does really simplify your blogging and save your time. With Live Writer you don&#39;t have to write a post in Word and then paste it to your blog, sometimes you even have to paste it to a another editor in order to get rid of Word text formatting. Now you don&#39;t have to do that.

  

Windows Live Writer supports many blogging platform, from Live Spaces to BlogEngine.NET and WordPress

  

Windows Live Writer has a built-in spell checker, so you don&#39;t need Word to check your spelling, it has nice formatting features, it supports different plug-in, so you can get a syntax highlighter, which is not available by default unfortunately.&nbsp; 

  

You can preview your posts, post preview is integrated into your blog design that looks awesome.

  

The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that it&#39;s not very obvious how to add new tags, because when your click the &quot;TAG&quot; button it only lists the existing tags, you can add new ones in the &quot;Keywords field in the properties section.

	If you have a blog, then you want to promote it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are motivated by money or by recognition.&nbsp; It you release your writings to public, then you want people to read them. Nowadays one of the most popular promotion techniques is sending links to social bookmarking web sites. The most popular social bookmarking web site is <a href="http://www.digg.com/" target="_blank">Digg.com</a>. But does Digg work perfectly for every blog? I mean, can you promote every blog with Digg?

	In the <a href="/post/Introducing-Microsoft-SQL-Server-Compact-Edition-(Part-I).aspx" target="_blank">previous part of the tutorial</a> we learnt how to use SQL Server Compact Edition in our application. In this part we are going to learn how to synchronize the data between Compact Edition and a regular verson of SQL Server.
<br /> Visual Studio 2008 has built-in Synchronization Services that we&rsquo;ll be using in our project.

	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition</a> is an embeded database that allows you to integrate it in your destkop and mobile applications. It can be used in a variety of scenarios, just some examples:
<ul>
<li>a single-user application that still stores its data in the SQL database</li>
<li>a local cache of a remote SQL Server database,</li>
<li>a mobile application that synchronizes its local compact database with a remote database from time to time.</li>
</ul>
SQL Server Compact Edition takes about 1.5 MB on HDD and consumes about 5 MB of RAM. It&rsquo;s free to use and free to distribute with your application.

	As you may notice I don&rsquo;t use categories in my blog, only tags. Whether it&rsquo;s good or bad &ndash; is a matter of another topic.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m going to talk about how to make the archive work properly if you don&rsquo;t have any categories, because it doesn&rsquo;t display any posts unless they are filed under some category. I hope this will be fixed in the next versions, but you can fix it yourself, it&rsquo;s not difficult.

	I read about the PHP Implementation of LINQ called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPLinq" target="_blank">PHPLinq</a>. Frankly, I was sceptical about it. Finally, I gave it a try. I still remain sceptical...
<br /> Let&rsquo;s me explain why. Take a look at this fairly simple example

	I remember a moment that happened some weeks ago when Google was unavailable to me. I needed to search for something, but I couldn&rsquo;t reach Google. I could visit other web sites, but not Google. I asked my friends if Google was working for them, some of them told me that it was working, while other ones said that it wasn&rsquo;t working for them either. In a few minutes it started working again. So, I suppose it was a temporary problem with my ISP, probably some DNS problems.
<br /> But I swear it was such a frustrating moment!

	Have you ever faced a situation when you need to manipulate Excel spreadsheets with PHP on the server that is running Linux? If you had a Windows Server you could use PHP COM extensions. However they are unavailable on Linux.
<br /> Hopefully, there is a solution. It is called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338205.aspx" target="_blank">Open XML</a>. It&rsquo;s a new format of Microsoft Office documents introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. Basically, an Open XML file is a ZIP archive that contains XML files that represent the document mark-up. You can view it yourself or read some documentation, my article isn&rsquo;t about Open XML, but about the PHP library for working with Excel 2007 files. It also supports Excel 97 format by incor

porating a PEAR library.
<br /> The library is called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a>. It allows you to read/write Excel spreadsheets, save them in many formats including PDF and HTML. It supports formulas,styles and etc.

	Do you remember your first experience of using a computer? It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was DOS with Norton Commander or Windows. Anyway you had to learn how to find the necessary applications, how to execute them, once again it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you clicked on the folders and files on the blue background or used the Start menu. It&rsquo;s important that you learnt the definitions or metaphors; you learnt that icon is an application or something else; you learnt that you have to click twice on it to open it and so on.
<br /> Having got used to those metaphors, we easily use a computer unless we face an application with a non-standard interface that confuses us because we have to learn again.
