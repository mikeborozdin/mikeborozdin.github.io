	I noticed that the times of posts and comments were displayed in my local time zone. It must be very confusing for the users, especially if those times were the times of the comments they posted.
<br /> The first idea that came to my mind was just to use the GMT time zone. I set up the time zone offset in the blog settings, changed the templates, basically, I just put &ldquo;GMT&rdquo; after the time.
<br /> Anyway that still wasn&rsquo;t good enough. I wanted the times of the posts and comments to be displayed in the local time zones of my readers.

	<h1><a href="/post/syntax-highlighting-in-blogenginenet">Syntax Highlighting In BlogEngine.NET</a></h1>
	
It is not obvious that BlogEngine.NET has a built-in syntax highlighting extension. I mean the current versions 1.3.1, I&#39;m not sure about the old versions though. Anyway you can find it in the extensions settings, it is enabled by default.


So, if you need to paste a code snipped, just paste it in the text area and surround it with the [ code:&lt;language&gt;][/code ] tags


&lt;language&gt; may has one of the following values:

<ul>
	<li>c#</li>
	<li>vb</li>
	<li>js</li>
	<li>html</li>
	<li>xml</li>
	<li>tsql</li>
	<li>msh (Windows PowerShell script language)</li>
</ul>

It can take some other parameters, like ln for toggling line numbers, however if you set this parameter your layout will get broken for some reasons.

	<h1><a href="/post/facebook-lose-millions">Facebook Lose Millions</a></h1>
	Of course, they don&rsquo;t have the million losses; however they are missing millions of potential dollars and users.
<br /> You may have already heard about the Facebook clones. We have one in Russia, it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://vkontakte.ru">vkontakte.ru</a>, there are more than 13 million registered users, while there are only about 80 thousand Russian users on Facebook.
<br /> Why? I mean why so many people in Russia use the clone instead of Facebook? Not only because the Facebook interface is English, but because it lacks Russian universities and schools, so it doesn&rsquo;t fullfil its primary function &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t help people to find each other, it&rsquo;s hard to find your classmates, it&rsquo;s hard to find people you study in university with. I tried to add my university to the list, I wrote an e-mail, but for some reasons it wasn&rsquo;t added.

	<h1><a href="/post/difference-between-labeltext-and-textboxtext-(winforms)-in-treating-line-breaks">Difference Between Label.Text And TextBox.Text (WinForms) In Treating Line Breaks</a></h1>
	I had a small project recently that outputted the results of some calculations to the label on the form, I replaced the label with a textbox and noticed that instead of the line breaks I had in the label I got a bunch of non-printed characters.
