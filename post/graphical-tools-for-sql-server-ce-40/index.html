    <h1>Graphical Tools for SQL Server CE 4.0</h1>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When I was writing my <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Introducing-SQL-Server-CE-40-CTP.aspx" target="_blank">introductory post</a> about the newly released version of SQL Server or more precisely about just a CTP (Community Technology Preview) version, I complained about an apparent lack of graphical tools similar to SQL Server Management Studio or at least similar to Visual Studio Server Explorer. Such a lack made an exploration of indeed promising features of SQL Server CE 4.0 a slightly tricky task. However, as I pointed out in my previous post that shouldn’t&#160; actually prevent programmers from playing with this database, because in spite of non-existence of GUI tools there was already an API released, thus it was possible to interact with the database system by just issuing SQL statements from C# or any other .NET language.</p>  <p>However, I was wrong in my statement about a lack of GUI tools, in fact they do exists. <!-- more --></p>  <h2></h2>  <h2></h2>  <h2>WebMatrix</h2>  <p>The first tool to write about is surprisingly WebMatrix that is not only a simplified web page editor, albeit with a support of a new ASP.NET MVC template engine called Razor, but also a tool for managing SQL CE 4.0 databases. Furthermore, if you haven’t installed CE 4.0, you can get one bundled with WebMatrix, plus a whole bunch of other useful applications that can be easily installed with Web Platform Installer.</p>  <p>At the first glance WebMatrix may scare serious developers with its slightly childish simplicity, but anyway in order to start working with SQL CE 4.0 it is necessary to either create a web site or use a folder as a website or whatsoever in WebMatrix to make it create a some kind of a project. Fortunately, it just takes a few second and then it rewards us with an option called “Databases”.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/images/image_1.png" width="640" height="400" /> </p>  <p>On clicking “Add a Database to your site” or “New Database” in the toolbar it creates a new .sdf file that is meant to contain your CE database.&#160; Then, you can start creating tables and populating them with data, as well as issuing SQL queries.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/images/image_2.png" width="640" height="387" /> </p>  <p>Moreover, WebMatrix allows performing a migration from CE server to a regular version of SQL Server, in that case it still can be kept as a database tool, since it also works with SQL Server and even MySQL , plus supports dealing with views and stores procedures, which is pretty good for WebMatrix that has an image of a toy. </p>  <p>There is one thing that might be a little bit confusing at first. How do I open a database that wasn’t created by WebMatrix? Fortunately, there is a simple workaround, just copy to the App_Data folder of your website and WebMatrix will hook it automatically.</p>  <p>WebMatrix is available <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <h2>SQL Server Compact Toolbox</h2>  <p>It is a free tool that was recommended me by its author <a href="http://erikej.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Erik Ejlskov Jensen</a> who told me about it in his comment to <a href="http://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/Introducing-SQL-Server-CE-40-CTP.aspx" target="_blank">my previous post</a>. This tool is both available as a standalone application and a Visual Studio add-in. Frankly, I don’t see a point of having it as a standalone application because I can use above mentioned WebMatrix instead that also has more features, however having it as an add-in in Visual Studio is indeed a good thing that doesn’t force you to switch a context between two development environments. </p>  <p>Moreover, it looks pretty similar Server Explorer that is available in Visual Studio by default, however it lacks some features, for instance, it’s possible to create or modify a table by using graphical tools, instead you have to write SQL statements, on the other hand you can at least view all the tables and perform queries against them. </p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/images/image_3.png" width="640" height="400" /> </p>  <p>SQL Server toolbox and its source code are available on <a href="http://sqlcetoolbox.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>.</p>
