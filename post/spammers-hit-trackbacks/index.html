    <h1>Spammers Hit Trackbacks</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It&rsquo;s really sad, but true. Spammers hit trackbacks. Recently, you could prevent spam in comments by enforcing registration or adding a CAPTCHA or by simply enabling comment moderation. Now it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder. Spammers post trackbacks links that lead people to their scummy web sites, most of them are porn web sites. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think they are going to attract visitors to their web sites in this way, instead they are trying to increase their PageRank, I think. <!-- more --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging for about a half of a year. Everybody can comment on my posts, however comments have to be approved by me first, but I have never forced people to register or pass a CAPTCHA and I don&rsquo;t remember receiving any spam posts until the recent times, when some Busby SEO Test started posting comments. I must admit it was a pretty clever bot, but it still generated scum comments.</p>
<p>Anyway, the amount of spam was pretty tolerable besides it has never gone approved. But everything changes. In the past two days, I&rsquo;ve been getting spam posts disguised as trackbacks that is really nasty, because trackbacks don&rsquo;t need to be approved, they become visible to visitors after they get posted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really unpleasant that such a useful service as the trackback can get a bad reputation because of the spam abuse.</p>
<p>After Googling for a while, I found out that this problem isn&rsquo;t a new one, I came across the mentions of it that dated back to 2005, this basically means that I just didn&rsquo;t face it, because I wasn&rsquo;t a blogger.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s crucial to prevent trackback spamming, I wonder if anybody knows a good solutions that works with BlogEngine.NET 1.4.5. It&rsquo;s also interesting to know who anyone fights with the trackback spam.</p>
